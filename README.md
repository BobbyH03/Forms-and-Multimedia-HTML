# Forms-and-Multimedia-HTML
This is a very basic form held inside a table for viewing purposes, all created with HTML and a bit of CSS to spice things up. I've also added some multimedia to demonstrate proficiency. Data entered into this form can be viewed but is not stored, this webpage is for visuals only.
